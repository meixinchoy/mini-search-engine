Sir Ian Terence Botham, OBE (born 24 November 1955) is an English former first-class cricketer, active 1974â€“1993, who played mainly for Somerset and also for Worcestershire, Durham and Queensland. He represented England in 102 Test matches and 116 Limited Overs Internationals. He later became a cricket commentator. He was a right-handed batsman and, as a right arm fast-medium bowler, was noted for his swing bowling. He generally fielded close to the wicket, predominantly in the slips. Skilled in all three disciplines, Botham was a genuine all-rounder. In Test cricket, he scored 5,200 runs including 14 centuries with a highest score of 208; he took 383 wickets with a best return of eight for 34; and he held 120 catches. From 1986 to 1988, he held the world record for the highest number of career wickets in Test cricket. He took five wickets in an innings (5wI) 27 times and 10 wickets in a match (10wM) four times. In 1980, he became the second player in Test history to complete the "match double" of scoring 100 runs and taking 10 wickets in the same match; his feat included a century and he was the first of only two players to score a century and take ten wickets in the same Test match. In all first-class cricket, he scored 19,399 runs including 38 centuries with a highest score of 228; he took 1,172 wickets with the same best return of eight for 34, 59 5wI and eight 10wM; he held 354 catches. On 8 August 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. Botham has at times been involved in controversy including a highly publicised court case involving rival all-rounder Imran Khan and an ongoing dispute with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). These incidents, allied to his on-field success, have attracted media attention, especially from the tabloid press. Botham has made effective use of the fame given to him by the publicity because he is actively concerned about leukaemia in children and has undertaken several long distance walks to raise money for research into the disease. These efforts have been highly successful and have realised millions of pounds for Bloodwise, of which he became president. In recognition of his services to charity, he was awarded a knighthood in the 2007 New Years Honours List. Botham has a wide range of sporting interests outside cricket. He was a talented footballer at school and had to choose between cricket and football as a career. He chose cricket but, even so, he did play professional football for a few seasons and made eleven appearances in the Football League for Scunthorpe United. He is a keen golfer and his other pastimes include angling and shooting.
