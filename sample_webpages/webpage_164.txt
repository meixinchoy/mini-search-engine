Kabaddi is a contact team sport that originated in India. It is popular in South Asia and is the state game of the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. It is also the national sport of Bangladesh. Two teams compete, each occupying its own half of the court. They take turns sending a "raider" into the opposing team's half and earn points if the raider manages to touch opposing team members and return to the home half, all while chanting word "kabaddi". However, if the raider is tackled and prevented from returning, the opposing team gets the point. The game is known by its regional names in different parts of the subcontinent, such as Kabaddi or "Chedugudu" in Andhra Pradesh Kabaddi in Karnataka and Telangana, hadudu in Bangladesh, bhavatik in Maldives, kauddi or kabaddi in the Punjab region, Hu-Tu-Tu in Western India and Hu-Do-Do in Eastern India and chadakudu in south India. In earlier versions, the raider had to continuously sing a song, which varied by region. This was later condensed to repeating the name of the game (Kabaddi, Sadugudu, etc).
