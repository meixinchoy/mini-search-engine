The Great Vowel Shift was a major series of changes in the pronunciation of the English language that took place in southern England, primarily between 1350 and the 1600s and 1700s. Through the Great Vowel Shift, all Middle English long vowels changed their pronunciation. English spelling was becoming standardized in the 15th and 16th centuries, and the Great Vowel Shift is responsible for many of the peculiarities of English spelling.
