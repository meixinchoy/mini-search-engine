An abjad (pronounced  or ) is a type of writing system where each symbol stands for a consonant, leaving the reader to supply the appropriate vowel. The name abjad is based on the old Arabic alphabet's first four letters – a, b, j, d – to replace the common terms "consonantary", "consonantal alphabet" or "syllabary" to refer to the family of scripts called West Semitic.
