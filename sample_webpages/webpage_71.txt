The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) is an executive department within the U.S. state of California. Caltrans manages the state highway system (which includes the California Freeway and Expressway System) and is involved with public transportation systems throughout the state. It supports Amtrak California and the Capitol Corridor. The department is part of the state cabinet-level California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA). Like the majority of state government agencies, Caltrans is headquartered in Sacramento. In 2015, Caltrans released a new mission statement: "Provide a safe, sustainable, integrated and efficient transportation system to enhance Californiaâ€™s economy and livability."
