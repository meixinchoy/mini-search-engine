Hispaniola (Spanish: La Española; Latin: Hispaniola; Taíno: Haiti) is the 22nd-largest island in the world, located in the Caribbean island group, the Greater Antilles. It is the second largest island in the Caribbean after Cuba, and the most populous island in the Caribbean; the eleventh most populous island in the world. The 76,192-square-kilometre (29,418 sq mi) island is divided between two sovereign nations, the Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic (48,445 km2, 18,705 sq mi), and French-speaking Haiti (27,750 km2, 10,710 sq mi). The only other shared island in the Caribbean is Saint Martin, which is shared between France (Saint-Martin) and the Netherlands (Sint Maarten). Hispaniola is the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas, founded by Christopher Columbus on his voyages in 1492 and 1493.
